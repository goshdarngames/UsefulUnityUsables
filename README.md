# UsefulUnityUsables
A collection of scripts and example scenes to help prototype games.

There are 2 folders in the root of the project.  Each one is a Unity
project.  One is to serve as a repository for 2D examples and the other
is for 3D.

The example projects are self contained projects within the main
project's Asset folder.
